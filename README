Welcome to Aegis. Aegis is divided into following maven projects, each with its own GIT repository :

aegis-client-java - This project. Meant for Integrators of Aegis enforcement engine - eg 
             developers wanting to incorporate Aegis enforcement to define and
             enforce policies in their own apps.
aegis-core - Provides the core engine source and tests.
             Use this project if you are a Contributor to the Aegis core
aegis-raptor -  Provides Raptor integration. Meant for Raptor developers
             wanting to incorporate Aegis functionality for their raptor apps.

Eclipse Instructions:
======================
Prerequisites :
 Install Eclipse classic or equivalent
 Download and install Maven Eclispse plugin :
     Maven Integration for Eclipse and Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP.
 [Optional] Download & install EGit plugin from: http://eclipse.org/egit/

1) Clone the aegis-client-java to a local directory.
   To do this, you can either :
    - Install the GIT plugin in eclipse and use its GIT Explorer feature 
      to clone the GIT repository to your local directory
      [Note : Do not create a GIT project in Eclipse as yet]
    OR
    - Execute the git command  on a terminal window. Eg:
        git clone <repository>
 
2) Create a Eclipse Maven Project
   (a) Start Eclipse and select File->Import...
   (b) select "Maven->Maven Project" (if maven is missing....)
   (c) "Import" dialog : Select "Existing Maven Projects"
      "Select maven projects" dialog- Click "Browse.." and naviagte to
      the directory containing pom.xml starting with the GIT repository
      cloned in step 1 (eg aegis-client-java).
3) Build and run tests :
   Select root of the eclipse project - execute "Run As..." -> 'maven test' 

4a) Test drive Java SE samples : Standalone Java appl :Execute AegisSample :
   Navigate to samples
   Execute Run As... -> Java Application.

4b) Test drive JavaEE samples : web application : 
   Execute mvn jetty:run to start a jetty server - and then invoke http://localhost:8080/index.jsp in a  browser
   OR
   Deploy target/aegis*.war in a Java app server (eg Tomcat) - and invoke : http://<host>:<port>/<deploy>/index.jsp in a browser
   The wizard will guide thru the next steps, which involve :
      - Setting up bootstrap info in a local directory
      - Creating up a sample session (simple cookie)
      - Protecting a webcmd app in 2 modes : direct invocation of Aegis PEP within the app or via a servlet Filter
       

Dependencies:
==============
The project needs aegis-core, JUnit and JSON jars.
json.jar and junit-4.10.jar are through maven. You do not need to do anything.
At this point -aegis-core dependency is met locally - so you must install aegis-core maven locally.
TODO : Add aegis-core to managed maven.

Directory structure:
====================

src/main/java/ : contains source files of samples
src/main/java/samples/CustomEvaluator : contains source files of Aegis plugins
src/main/java/samples/filter : contains source file of a servlet filter based PEP
src/test/java : Junit test
src/main/resources/ : Properties file used by the samples

CLI commands To build and run:
==============================

Navigate to directory containing pom.xml
#cd <gitdir>/aegis-client-java

Execute tests
# mvn test

# Cleanup
# mvn clean
 
# Jetty
# mvn jetty:run
